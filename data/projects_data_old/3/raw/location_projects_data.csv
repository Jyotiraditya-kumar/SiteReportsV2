144899,Unique Feronia,"Unique Feronia is a row house project designed on the theme of self sustainability concept. This is India&rsquo;s first fully solar powered housing project. We at UF generate electricity harnessing the sun's solar energy.<br /><br /> UF uses Eco-friendly, reliable and very strong- Stabilized Hydraulic pressed mud blocks (SMB). These bricks are interlinked and dense so they have two times more load bearing capacity than the conventional bricks.. It also acts as an insulator from external temperature and adds up aesthetic values. <br /><br />The garbage is not a problem anymore. The dry and wet wastes are separated at source so that the wet waste is converted into manure/compost to grow organic fruits &amp; vegetable and in our gardens across our project. The dry waste is handed over to the vendor/recycling from time to time. <br /><br />The Rain water is collected through rain water harvesting system which can be used for many purposes. Apart from this the water that comes out of our kitchen and bathrooms are thoroughly processed in our advanced STP and is reused for gardening and other purposes. <br /><br />All the vehicles are parked in the basement, a dedicated closed parking area without allowing it to the residential zone to keep it free from pollution and safe. <br /><br />An indoor swimming pool not just conserves water but also saves electricity. <br /><br />The UNIQUE ADVANTAGES: <br /><br />MAINTENANCE ADVANTAGE: The components that make up the maintenance cost in the future are mainly electricity and water. The above concept not only addresses the environmental issues but also reduces the maintenance cost up to 50% compared to any other conventional housing projects. <br /><br />SPACE ADVANTAGE: This 2 acre project comprises only 63 units giving you an highest advantage of bigger UDS, which is upto 80% double compared to an apartment. <br /><br />COST ADVANTAGE: Good news for home seekers.
